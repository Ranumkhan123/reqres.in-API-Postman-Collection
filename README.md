# Reqres.in API - Postman Test Collection

This repository contains a full Postman test suite built using the [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in) public API — a dummy API designed for frontend/backend testing. The collection demonstrates CRUD operations, data validation, response testing, and automation-ready scripting using Postman features.

---

# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to perform comprehensive API testing using industry-standard tools and techniques. This comprises of:

- Creating a modular and reusable Postman Collection.
- Using environment variables for enhanced flexibility.
- Automating test execution with Newman.
- Generating visual test reports in both HTML and PDF formats.
- Practicing real-world scenarios, such as authorization, edge cases, and error handling.
- Conducting API monitoring for scheduled health checks.

---

# Monitor Setup
- A monitor has been set up in Postman to run key test cases every week.
- Alerts are shown for any failed test.
- Response time, size, and status are validated in scheduled runs.

---

# Technologies Used

- Postman – For API requests, environments, and testing
- Newman – For CLI-based test automation
- Postman Monitors – For continuous monitoring and alerting
- HTML Reporter – For visual test result reports
- JavaScript – For assertions, scripting and chaining

---

# How to Run

- Import ReqRes_collection.json into Postman.
- Import environment (reqresenv.json) into Postman.
- Run requests step-by-step or as a collection.
- Open Console to view logs.
