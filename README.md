# Reqres.in API - Postman Test Collection

This repository contains a full Postman test suite built using the [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in) public API — a dummy API designed for frontend/backend testing. The collection demonstrates CRUD operations, data validation, response testing, and automation-ready scripting using Postman features.

---

# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to perform comprehensive API testing using industry-standard tools and techniques.The features that covered are:

- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests
- Collection and environment variables
- Pre-request & Test Scripts
- Response body & status code validation
- Dynamic data assertions
- Real-time scenarios and error handling
- Newman support for CLI test execution
- Screenshots for visual reference

---

# Monitor Setup
- A monitor has been set up in Postman to run key test cases every week.
- Alerts are shown for any failed test.
- Response time, size, and status are validated in scheduled runs.

---

# Technologies Used

- Postman – For API requests, environments, and testing
- Newman – For CLI-based test automation
- Postman Monitors – For continuous monitoring and alerting
- HTML Reporter – For visual test result reports
- JavaScript – For assertions, scripting and chaining

---

# How to Run

1. Import the Collection and Environment files.
2. Set the active environment as `reqresenv`.
3. Run the full collection or individual requests.
4. Check the **Console** and **Tests tab** for assertions.

# Note

This collection is built on the mock API provided by Reqres.in. It's safe for public testing and doesn't store real data.
